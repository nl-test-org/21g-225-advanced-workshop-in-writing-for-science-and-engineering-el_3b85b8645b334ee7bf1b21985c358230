Course Description
------------------

If you are a junior, senior or graduate student in the sciences or engineering at MIT and if your English skills are advanced but your writing needs further development, 21G.225 / 6 is the right place for you. This workshop is grounded in current applied linguistics and genre research; and it provides the opportunity to analyze, practice and receive feedback on many of the types of professional and academic documents that you will write in your engineering or science studies and careers. _You will find the workshop most productive if you are already engaged in a research project; you can then use the literature and data related to own research in the course assignments_.

The workshop content builds cumulatively; each module and assignment builds on the one before. Class members are frequently the authors of the work under review and are occasionally responsible for leading group discussions and making short presentations. Regular attendance, timely completion of assignments, and constructive participation throughout the semester are crucial to the learning process and to the success of the workshop.

Goals and Expectations
----------------------

In 21G.225 / 6, you can expect to improve efficiency and fluency through drafting, revising, and sharing in the writing process. You will learn how to anticipate reader's needs and meet their expectations. You will become familiar with appropriate genre conventions in your discipline. You will sharpen your editing skills to increase accuracy in sentence structure and word choice, and you will develop confidence in yourself as a global professional.
