Follow the steps below as you discuss the documents of your group members, one at a time:

1.  Before you read anything, decide whether the document's appearance welcomes the non-specialist reader.
    *   Is there a catchy or informative title?
    *   Is the format reader-friendly? (paragraphs, topic sentences, sentence length, space)
    *   Does the format reflect the conventions of the genre, whether an Op-Ed piece, a news release or an essay for Ashdown Newsletter?
2.  After reading the document, do you _understand_ the concept?
    *   Is the language accessible?
    *   Is the use of jargon purposeful?
    *   Can you answer the question "Why should I care about this topic?"?
3.  How did the author help you in your understanding of the concept and its importance?
    *   Are the original sources for data or information provided where needed?
4.  What suggestions do you have for the author to make the document more reader-friendly?
    *   Add examples, analogies, word pictures?
    *   Create a better "hook" in the title or in the first paragraph?
    *   Include diagrams or photos?
    *   Reduce jargon or complex data?
    *   Improve readability by modifying writing style and word choice?
5.  Have you noticed any problems with coherence, word choice, tone or punctuation?
    *   Provide concrete examples.
